## About Docker and Containers

> Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers—standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.
> 
> Containers are made possible by process isolation and virtualization capabilities built into the Linux kernel. These capabilities—such as control groups (Cgroups) for allocating resources among processes, and namespaces for restricting a process's access or visibility into other resources or areas of the system—enable multiple application components to share the resources of a single instance of the host operating system in much the same way that a hypervisor enables multiple virtual machines (VMs) to share the CPU, memory and other resources of a single hardware server.

## About Docker Dev Environments

> Dev Environments lets you create a configurable developer environment with all the code and tools you need to quickly get up and running.
> 
> It uses tools built into code editors that allows Docker to access code mounted into a container rather than on your local host. This isolates the tools, files and running services on your machine allowing multiple versions of them to exist side by side.
